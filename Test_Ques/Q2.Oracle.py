"""
In Geek-land, there are m flight routes with n airport terminals. Â¡th flight route will connect
airport terminal a; to b; incurring cost ci. Now the king of Geek-land wants to start a flight from
airport terminal 1 which will stop at terminal n. Help him calculate the maximum possible cost
on a finite route he may need to spend and If not possible return -1.
Example 1:
Input: n = 5, m=7, routes = {{1,2,9},{1,3,10},
{1,4,2},{1,5,6},{2,4,14},{2,5,2},{4,5,11}}
Output: 34
Explanation: Maximum possible total cost can
be 34 if flight will take the route as
1->2->4->5 = 9 +14 +11 = 34.
Example 2:
0
Input: n = 5, m=4,routes = {{1,5,1},{2,5,7},
(3,4,6}{3.5.13}},
Output: 1
